Reference material for requesting an event. Here you'll find all the little details regarding the event request page. All inputs, etc, and which are optional and which are required.

## Inputs

There are many different textboxes that need your attention in order to request a new event.

**Required Input from You:**
 - Title (the name of the event)
 - Date of the Event

:::caution 
Without the above textboxes filled out, you will be unable to request a new event.
:::

**Optional Input from You:**
 - All Day Event?
 - Public Event?
 - Reucrring Event
 - Set up and clean up duration
 - Notifications
 - Public Description
 - Internal Notes

## Title

 - This is a `required` field. You cannot submit a new event request without it.

The title can be whatever you want, but ideally, it should be short and descriptive. For example, if you're having a Mass in honor of St. Peter, you should title it **Mass - St. Peter** or whatever naming convention your parish prefers. 

:::note 
You cannot use any HTML in the title, but you can add emojis! ðŸ˜€
:::

## Date and Time

 - The date, start time and end time are `required` fields. You cannot submit a new event request without them.

When you click on any of these fields, a small popup will appear allowing you to modify the particular attribute. When clicking on the date field, you'll see a calendar that will allow you to select the date of the event. When you click on the the start time field, you will see a small box appear that allows you to select the start time of the event (all times are in your local timezone). When you click on the end time field, you will see a small box appear that allows you to select the end time of the event (this time is in your local timezone).

:::caution 
Your start time must be before the end time, for obvious reasons.

## Room Selection

 - Room selection is a `required` field. You cannot submit a new event request without it.

Room selection is a major part of planning. In order to facilitate the calendaring of the parish, you must select a room or tell us you specifically don't need one in order to submit the request. **You can skip selecting a room if you select 'This event does not require any rooms.'** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room selection, however, is pretty straight forward. Just click on the '**Manage Rooms**' button and a large popup will appear allowing you to select all the rooms you need for your event. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Prior to selecting a room**, you'll need to fill out the date, start, and end time fields. The system will remind you of this if you forget.

:::caution
If you do not see the room you want in the popup, it means that your room is already booked by someone else for that day and time.
:::

## Ministry Selection

 - Ministry selection is a `required` field. You cannot submit a new event request without it.

The ministry drop down is where you select which ministry this event belongs to. It **must** belong to a ministry. This is how we organize all the events. 

When you click on the ministry selection, a dropdown will appear. Here you can search for your ministry by typing into the text box, or scrolling until you find your ministry. For larger parishes, it's possible you won't see your ministry in the dropdown. Don't worry! It just means your parish has a lot going on, and you'll just have to search for your ministry. Once you start typing in the first few letters of your ministry into the dropdown, you should be able to see it pretty quickly.

**If you cannot find your ministry** in the dropdown, it's possible your parish hasn't added your ministry yet. You should contact your calendar admin and ask them to add it. In the meantime, you can select a default ministry from the list so that your event request isn't delayed. You can update the ministry at a later time.

:::note
If you do not see your ministry in the dropdown, it just means you have to search for it in the little textbox that shows with the dropdown. Just the first few letters will help!
:::

## All Day Event

 - All Day Event is an `optional` field.

If you have an all day event, you can switch this on in the event request. When an all day event is switched on, your event will appear in a small section at the top of the Calendar indicating to other users that this is an all day event. 

:::danger
Your times will be overwritten by switching this option on. Your date will not be overwritten.
:::

## Public Event

 - Public Event is an `optional` field.

Turn this option on if you want your event to be visible to the public. 

## Recurring Events

 - Recurring Event is an `optional` field.

Recurring events has quite a bit of info about it, so please check out its dedicated documentation here: [Recurring Events](/{{route}}/{{version}}/cal_recurring)

## Set Up and Clean Up

 - Set-Up and Clean-Up Duration is `optional`.

You can easily manage the buffer before and after your event using the special "**+ Set-Up/Clean-Up Duration**" button on the event request page. It is available in increments upto 3 hours. Anything more than that and you'll beed to request another event to cover the time-span you're looking for.

:::caution
The date, start, and end time of your event must be set before you can adjust the set-up and clean-up duration.
:::

## Notifications

 - Notifications are `optional`.

Managing notifications for your event is easy. Click on the **+ Notifications** button on the event request page. This will pop open a little window for you to add either individual users or groups of users. You can view which people are in which group by clicking **Your Parish Name > Notification Lists** and then looking through the groups on that page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you select groups/users, be sure they want to receive notifications about your event. These users and groups will be notified upon each approval change, when/if your event date/time is changed, and 24 hours prior to the start of your event.

:::danger
Too many notifications can be annoying if you don't want them. Be sure your users and groups want to receive notifications about your event before adding them.

 - Public description is `optional`.

This is displayed publicly to all users and the public (if you've set it as a public event). You can use Markdown in this input. To learn more about Markdown, please visit <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank">this website</a>.
