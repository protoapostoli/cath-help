## Invite New User

So you're trying to add a new user to your parish? Cool. This is pretty easy. Just follow the steps below:
 - Login to Catholic Office.
 - At the top of the page, locate and click the name of your parish.
 - Next, click on Parish Settings.
 - Now, scroll down to the section that says, 'Add User to Catholic Office Team.'
 - In the textbox in this section, type in the email of the person you want to invite.
 - Click on either Administrator or User.
 - Finally, click on Add.
 - All done!

That was easy. :)

## Accept Invitation

In order to accept an invitation and start using the system, you'll need to be sure your Calendar Admin has sent you an invite. Check your email (including your spam folder) for an email from Catholic Office.

Once you have an invite, open the email and click the button to accept the inivitation and be taken to the registration form. On the registration form, you'll need to fill out all the required fields before submitting. Once you have submitted the registration form, you'll be able to login using the login link on <https://catholicoffice.com>.

## Delete User

Unfortunately, you cannot delete a user from your parish. Some of your data is attached to their account. So, what we can do, is remove their access and then rename them to 'deleted user,' or whatever you want. This will prevent them from accessing their account. You'll need to contact Catholic Office at [admin@catholicoffice.com](mailto:admin@catholicoffice.com) to accomplish this. Just drop us an email and we'll handle it from there.

## Reset Password

Reseting or updating your password is a piece of cake.
    - Login to Catholic Office.
    - At the top of the page, locate and click on your name.
    - Next, click on My Account.
    - Now, scroll down to the section that says, 'Update Password.'
    - In the textbox in this section, type in your current password, your new password, and then type in your new password once more just to make sure you type it in right.
    - Finally, click Save.
    - All done!

## Lost Password

So you've lost your password? No worries!
    - Head to [CatholicOffice.com](https://catholicoffice.com).
    - At the top of the page, locate and click Login (Yes, I know you lost your password, just bare with me).
    - Next, click on Forgot Your Password?
    - Follow the prompts on the page that pops up, and check your email to reset your password.
    - That's it!

(PS: If you see "DASHBOARD" instead of "LOGIN", you're already logged in, and you can check out the Reset Password section above.)
