title: Approve/Decline Events
---

:::tip
In order to approve or decline events, you must have permission to do so, or be the Calendar Admin.
:::

 - Once logged in, click the **Calendar** dropdown.
 - Click **Pending Events**
 - And then either:
   - Click the event name to open the event detail page and click Approve.
   - Or, click the checkbox next to the event(s) you want to approve/decline, and click **Actions** at the top of the table, and then **Approve Selected Events**

:::note
The calendar has a two-level approval system in place. Normally, the ministry leader approves the event before it goes before the Calendar Admin for approval.

HOWEVER, the Calendar Admin can bypass the ministry leader directly by approving events.
