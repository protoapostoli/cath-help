## Delete an Event

This can only be done by the Calendar Administrator. As a user, however, you can cancel your events, or request that the Calendar Admin go in and delete your event.

 - If you're a Calendar Administrator, in order to delete an event, find it on the Calendar Interface, click once, then press the backspace or delete button on your keyboard. This will delete the event.

:::caution 
This will remove the event from the calendar. Be sure you want to delete it. This places the event in the **Deleted Events** section of the app.

## Restore an Event

Calendar Admins can restore an event by going into the **Deleted Events** section, clicking the event title, and then clicking the **Restore Event** button.
