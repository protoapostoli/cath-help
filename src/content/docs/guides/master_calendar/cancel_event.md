Cancelling is simple, as long as you have permission. When cancelling your event, the system will append "CANCELED" to the event title and then release all the room reservations. 

:::caution
Canceled events can only be restored by the Calendar Admin. Be sure you want your event canceled.

## Who Can Cancel

**Requirements for cancelling events:**
 - You're the Calendar Admin
 - Or, you're the creator of the event (you manually submitted your own event in the system)
 - Or, you have permission in the system to edit/manage events

If you do not fall into one of these categories, then you won't be able to cancel a given event. For instance, if you asked the calendar admin to create your event, then that event is attached to the calendar admin, and you'll have to ask them to make any changes going forward.

:::tip
You might also have been given permission to manage all events. In this case, even if you don't own the event, you will be able to cancel all events.
