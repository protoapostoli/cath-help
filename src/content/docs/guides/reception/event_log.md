The event log is a simple tool for logging events that happen in the front office that are important enough to pass on to the next shift.

## Log New Event

It's simple to log a new event. 

 - Click the **+ Log New Event** button.
 - A window will pop up where you can enter as much information as you need.
   - At the very least, you need to add a description.
 
 - Optional Types and Flags
   - You can modify the **Event Type** and the **Flag**
   - Flags are used to flag an event for *important, follow up, to-do, etc*.
   - Event Types are set by your account manager, we have some defaults there that will probably work for most use cases.
