title: Sick Calls
---

Sick calls are divided into two primary categories.
 - First, the basic request for prayers/intercessions, and maybe a request for a visit from an EMHC.
 - Second, a visit from a priest.

## View All Sick Calls

In order to view all sick calls, you need to:

 - Click Reception on the dashboard.
 - Then click, "View All Sick Calls" on the reception page.
 - You can apply filters and search sick calls on this page.

## Submit a New Sick Call Request

 - First, click on **Reception** on your dashboard.
 - Then click the button **+ New Sick Call Request**.
 - Fill out all information you receive from the caller.
 - Hit **Create New Sick Call**

The system will route the request automatically to whomever is setup in the Reception section in Parish Settings.

## Submit a Request for Announcements & Intercessions

 - This is the same process as above for Sick Calls
 - The only difference is that you omit any information pertaining to a visit
