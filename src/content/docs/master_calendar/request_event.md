title: Request an Event
description: Basic outline of how the Event Request page works.
---

This is where you'll spend most of your time when you need a new event on the calendar, and a room reserved for the event. If you read and follow along, this form will be infintiely less intimidating than at first glance. We'll walk you through all the different fields/inputs and explain what each does, which ones you can skip, etc.

## How-To Basic

Requesting a new event couldn't be easier. 

### Step One
**First**, you'll need to be logged in. Once you are, you have a few options for getting to the 'Request New Event' page.

To get to the '**Request New Event**' page you can:
 - Go to the Parish Calendar, find the date and time you want your event, and then double click on an empty square on the calendar interface.
 - Or, Click the Request New Event square on the dashboard.
 - Or, Click the Calendar button at the top of the page, and then click '**Request New Event**.'

:::tip
Any of the above options will get you to the right spot to begin requesting a new event. The first option using the Parish Calendar 
will automatically fill in the date, the start time, and the end time of your event. (This can be really handy if you don't want to mess with dates & times!)
:::

### Step Two
**Second**, you'll need to fill out the event details. The bare minimum required details to successfully request an event are listed below. ([Required Details](#inputs)) In Addition to the title, date, start and end times, you'll also need to select a room and which ministry the event belongs to.

Instructions on filling out the various required and optional details can be found further down on this page. Please familiarize yourself with the various inputs and how to fill them out properly.  

### Step Three
**Third**, once you've filled out the details, and selected your room(s)/ministry, the last thing you have to do is click **Submit Event Request**. 
What happens next can take a few moments, or a few days depending on your parish's approval system and when your calendar administrator is online. All events go through an approval process. They are available for approval immediately after you submit your request, but sometimes people are busy, and may take a few days before they have the time to approve your event. Don't worry, though! Your event is safely stored in the database, and you'll be notified when it is approved or denied.

:::tip[Something to Note]
You can see your newly submitted request on the **My Events** page by clicking **Calendar > My Events** and then changing the filter to **Filter > Filter By Event Status > All Pending Events**.

## How-To Advanced

 - Go to http://catholicoffice.com and click on Login or Dashboard at the top right.
 - Click on '**Calendar**' with three dots next to it, it'll be immediately to the left of your name.
 - From the drop down menu, click '**Request New Event**'
 - On this screen, you'll need to fill out the following information:
   - Name of Event (it should look similar to this, just use your own name instead: "Spiritual Direction - Fr. Andrew")
   - Date of Event
   - Start Time
   - End Time
 - If you need to change the set-up and clean-up time, please click on '**Set-up/Clean-up duration**'. 
   - This will add a buffer to the start and/or end of your event.

   - This can only be done after you've selected the dates/times and added set-up and clean-up.
 - On the Ministry dropdown box (this is required), you'll need to scroll down and find your ministry. It might look something like: "Pastoral Care Commission \ Spiritual Direction." Alternatively, you can use the search box to find your ministry.
 - Optionally, you can put in a public description and internal notes, and even select particular people or group to keep updated on changes to this event.
 - Once the above is all filled out, you may click "**Submit Event Request**."

:::note 
Please note that submitting the form does not mean you're on the calendar, nor does it guarantee you'll get put on the calendar. This is just in lieu of the paper request forms. Whether you are approved or denied, you will be notified by email.

## Title

 - This is a `required` field. You cannot submit a new event request without it.

The title can be whatever you want, but ideally, it should be short and descriptive. For example, if you're having a Mass in honor of St. Peter, you should title it **Mass - St. Peter** or whatever naming convention your parish prefers. 

:::note 
You cannot use any HTML in the title, but you can add emojis! ðŸ˜€
:::

## Date and Time

 - The date, start time and end time are `required` fields. You cannot submit a new event request without them.

When you click on any of these fields, a small popup will appear allowing you to modify the particular attribute. When clicking on the date field, you'll see a calendar that will allow you to select the date of the event. When you click on the the start time field, you will see a small box appear that allows you to select the start time of the event (all times are in your local timezone). When you click on the end time field, you will see a small box appear that allows you to select the end time of the event (this time is in your local timezone).

> {warning} Your start time must be before the end time, for obvious reasons.

## Room Selection

 - Room selection is a `required` field. You cannot submit a new event request without it.

Room selection is a major part of planning. In order to facilitate the calendaring of the parish, you must select a room or tell us you specifically don't need one in order to submit the request. **You can skip selecting a room if you select 'This event does not require any rooms.'** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room selection, however, is pretty straight forward. Just click on the '**Manage Rooms**' button and a large popup will appear allowing you to select all the rooms you need for your event. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Prior to selecting a room**, you'll need to fill out the date, start, and end time fields. The system will remind you of this if you forget.

> {warning} If you do not see the room you want in the popup, it means that your room is already booked by someone else for that day and time.

## Ministry Selection

 - Ministry selection is a `required` field. You cannot submit a new event request without it.

The ministry drop down is where you select which ministry this event belongs to. It **must** belong to a ministry. This is how we organize all the events. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you click on the ministry selection, a dropdown will appear. Here you can search for your ministry by typing into the text box, or scrolling until you find your ministry. For larger parishes, it's possible you won't see your ministry in the dropdown. Don't worry! It just means your parish has a lot going on, and you'll just have to search for your ministry. Once you start typing in the first few letters of your ministry into the dropdown, you should be able to see it pretty quickly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**If you cannot find your ministry** in the dropdown, it's possible your parish hasn't added your ministry yet. You should contact your calendar admin and ask them to add it. In the meantime, you can select a default ministry from the list so that your event request isn't delayed. You can update the ministry at a later time.

> {info} If you do not see your ministry in the dropdown, it just means you have to search for it in the little textbox that shows with the dropdown. Just the first few letters will help!

## All Day Event

 - All Day Event is an `optional` field.

If you have an all day event, you can switch this on in the event request. When an all day event is switched on, your event will appear in a small section at the top of the Calendar indicating to other users that this is an all day event.

> {warning} The date, start, and end time of your event must be set before you can adjust the set-up and clean-up duration.

<a name="notifications"></a>

You can view which people are in which group by clicking **Your Parish Name > Notification Lists** and then looking through the groups on that page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you select groups/users, be sure they want to receive notifications about your event. These users and groups will be notified upon each approval change, when/if your event date/time is changed, and 24 hours prior to the start of your event.

> {danger.fa-close} Too many notifications can be annoying if you don't want them. Be sure your users and groups want to receive notifications about your event before adding them.
